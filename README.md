=====================

Puzzle from the www.cloudware.pl company

I found a maze on GoldenLine Cloudware profile. I am not sure if it is some old puzzle, or a hidden recruitation, but I am sharing with you a solution in Python whats so ever. It works with Pillow graphics library, but you needed to convert the image first. I uploaded ready png files.
